The Master said, "It is by the Odes that the mind is aroused. It is by the Rules of Propriety that the character is established. It is from Music that the finish is received."
——The Analects ,Tai Bo

Ritual and music is the oldest and most fundamental form of life for the Chinese people. Confucianism, while inheriting its rituals, reveals the spiritual value of ritual and music, that is, the understanding of human nature and ultimate concern contained in its role as a form of life that "achieves the way of heaven and conforms to human nature". Confucius took literacy and refinement as the ideals of ritual and music, and taught his disciples poetry, calligraphy, ritual and music, cultivating seventy-two sages and initiating later generations to pursue the personal ideals of a gentleman's cultivation.
