The germ of "rites" can be traced back to the witchcraft rituals and sacrificial culture of primitive society, while the logic of "music" originates from the harmonious way of emulating the nature of heaven and earth. This system of cultural symbols, the culture of rites and music, is a cultural path to an ideal world for human civilization developed by the early and wise Chinese nation with its unique moral rationality and humanism.
Rites and music culture appeared in the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the integration of ritual and music culture by the Duke of Zhou led to a unified form of ritual and music. During the Spring and Autumn Period, the rites and music were in disarray and society was out of order. In front of the reality that the rites and music were in disarray, Confucius released the benevolence into the rites and music and tried to give the rites and music culture a new vitality for its continual development from the spiritual and cultural reform and renovation. Since then, the aesthetic principles of Confucius' rites and music have been practiced by later generations, and the history of the Confucius Temple is the history of the mutual use of rites and music in ancient times.
