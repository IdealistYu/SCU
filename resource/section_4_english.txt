Confucianism aims for harmony among nations and peace under heaven. Confucius promoted rituals and music to oppose the oppression of the weak by the strong, extremes in politics, and advocated for the selection of virtuous leaders to achieve harmony among nations. This concept dates back to Confucius' era of multiple states and feudal lords, resonating even in today's complex world. 
Confucius believed the world's foundation lies in the state, the state's in the family, and the family's in individual cultivation. This interconnectedness reflects ancient aspirations for societal order and remains a shared pursuit in Chinese culture. Modern thinkers like Immanuel Kant echo Confucius in advocating for perpetual peace, making global harmony a universal ideal.
