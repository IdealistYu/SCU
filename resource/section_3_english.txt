The rites of passage in the Book of Rites consist mainly of the eight rites of coronation, marriage, funeral, sacrifice, township, archery, pilgrimage, and bride-price.Among them, the rites of the crown, marriage, funeral, and sacrifice are performed within the family, focusing on the major points in the individual's life course, and can be called the rites of life or family rites in the narrow sense.Archery and township rites are practiced in the states and townships, which are beyond the scope of the family and extend to a wider geographical social group, constituting the basic form of social etiquette. The rites of pilgrimage and bride-price are practiced in the imperial court and belong to the political rites. 
The Book of Rites summarizes: "The rite of passage begins with the crown, is rooted in the marriage, is emphasized in the funeral and the sacrifice, is honoured in the pilgrimage and the bride-price, and is harmonized with the archery and the township. This is the main body of the rites." From these eight rites, excluding the rites of worship and bride-price, all aspects of daily life in ancient times were woven together, that is, what Zhu Xi called: "Everything is a rite of passage."
